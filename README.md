### A Modern take on Cattle Management

This project is intended to make a simple to use cattle management web app that anyone can learn. Most apps that are data driven are often very plain and complex with many different levels that a user has to navigate to get the data that they want out of the app. My approach is to build the web app from the ground up trying to make the user interface as easy to use as possible and simplified down to only what the end user will want. And to do all that while still providing all the data integrity and statistics that users expect.

### Some features include

- Awesome User Interface
- Weight tracking
- Medical tracking
- Mother/Calf tracking
- Data Export
- Cattle bill of lading export
